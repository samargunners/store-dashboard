# Store-Locked Metrics Dashboard (Streamlit + Supabase)

One codebase â†’ many store deployments.  
Each deployment points to the same repo/branch but sets a different `STORE_PC` env var (e.g., `301290`).  
The app auto-selects the **latest date** for that store and renders:

- ðŸ’¼ Labor % to Sales â€” Weekly / MTD / QTD / YTD  
- ðŸ’µ Sales % change â€” Weekly / MTD / QTD / YTD (vs previous period)  
- ðŸ‘¥ Guest count % change â€” Weekly / MTD / QTD / YTD  
- ðŸ§¾ Void counts â€” Weekly / MTD / QTD / YTD  
- ðŸš— HME metrics (weighted by cars) â€” period deltas + daypart breakdown (last 7 days)
